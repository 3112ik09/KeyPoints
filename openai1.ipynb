It has become increasingly popular in recent years due to the rapid ad\nvancement of machine learning and deep learning algorithms.Computer vision has a wide range of applic\nations in our day-to-day lives. For example, it is used in: \n    • Self-driving cars: Computer vision algorithms help self-driving cars to identify and track objects on the \nroad, such as other vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signs. This information is used to safely navigate the\n car through the environment. \n    • Smartphones: Computer vision is used in a variety of smartphone applications, such as facial recognit\nion for unlocking the device, image editing and filtering, and augmented reality (AR) apps. \n    • Security systems: Computer vision is used in security systems to detect and identify intruders, as well \nas to monitor traffic and other activity in public areas. \n    • Healthcare: Computer vision is used in healthcare to develop new diagnostic tools and to assist surge\nons with complex procedures. \n    • Retail: Computer vision is used in retail to track inventory, manage self-checkout kiosks, and provide \npersonalized recommendations to customers. \nThese are just a few examples of the many ways in which computer vision is being used to improve our li\nves. As the technology continues to develop, we can expect to see even more innovative and groundbrea\nking applications emerge in the years to come. \nHere are some specific examples of how computer vision is being used in everyday life today: \n    • Unlocking your phone with your face: Face ID and other facial recognition technologies use computer \nvision to identify your face and unlock your phone. \n    • Taking selfies and photos: Computer vision is used to improve the quality of selfies and photos by adj\nusting the brightness, contrast, and other settings. \n    • Playing video games: Computer vision is used to create realistic graphics and gameplay in video gam\nes. \n    • Using augmented reality (AR) apps: AR apps use computer vision to overlay digital objects and inform\nation onto the real world. For example, you can use an AR app to try on clothes before you buy them or to\n visualize how a piece of furniture would look in your home. \n    • Shopping online: Online retailers use computer vision to recommend products to you based on your b\nrowsing history and purchase history. \n    • Using self-checkout kiosks: Self-checkout kiosks use computer vision to scan items and calculate tota\nl prices. \n    • Driving safely: Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) use computer vision to detect and track o\nbjects on the road, such as other vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signs. This information is used to warn \ndrivers of potential hazards and to assist with braking and steering. \nComputer vision is a rapidly evolving technology with a wide range of potential applications. As it become\ns more sophisticated and affordable, we can expect to see it integrated into even more aspects of our live\ns.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Basic Promt Example","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\nprod_review = \"\"\"\nI recently purchased this colorful backpack for my son's school needs. \\\nHe absolutely loves it and carries it with him every day.
